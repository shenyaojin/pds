# Pressure Diffusion Simulator

## Introduction

Library to simulate the wellbore pressure diffusion in Mariner. Should combine with DSS analyzer.

**Keywords**:
- 1D simulator
- FD method
- Using Mariner's PG data as a source
- Time sampling optimizer included

## Modules

- Lib
- Examples

## Usage

- TBD

I'm using RCP's remote server and my local Linux server to develop/debug the library at the same time; the commit would be quite often.

For now, this code is for personal research use only. I can't promise it can run in your local environment.
